# Arduino Uno Game Projects

## 1) 🐍 Snake with Joystick
This is a simple Snake game controlled with a joystick and enhanced with a buzzer for a better gaming experience.
### 🕹️ How to Play?
- Control the snake using the joystick.
- Alternatively, you can use buttons (requires modifications in the code).
### 🔊 Why a Buzzer?
- The buzzer beeps when the snake eats food and when it collides with itself, ending the game, providing auditory feedback.
- The snake's speed increases after eating food, making the game more difficult.
### ⚠️ Limitations
- Scores can be displayed using a **5161AS** (7-segment display), but the Arduino Uno runs out of available pins in this project.
